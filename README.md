# My Resume

Written in LaTeX.
Available in [PDF](https://github.com/creepid/resume/raw/master/Mikhail%20Rusakovich-Resume.pdf)

PDF compiler requires LaTeX engine to be installed. I used [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/download) (on Windows) and [texlive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (on Debian):

    pdflatex my-resume.tex

Online LaTeX preview and PDF compiler is avalable on [writelatex.com](https://www.writelatex.com).
